Atom and RSS feeds
==================

SOSSE can crawl `Atom <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)>`_ and `RSS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss>`_ feeds, this can be useful to crawl websites that are updated often, and skip already indexed pages. To index a syndication feed, it needs to be :doc:`queued explicitly <add_to_queue>`.

.. note::
   SOSSE crawler does not recurse into feeds declared in the ``<head>`` element of webpages. To crawl a feed, the URL of the XML feed must be added to the crawl queue manually.

Caching for news aggregators
----------------------------

By crawling syndication feeds, SOSSE can be used as an offline cache for news aggregator üêä softwares. After the XML feed is indexed, cached pages from the feed can be registered in the aggregator using the :ref:`atom feed <ui_atom_feeds>` generated by SOSSE. This can be done using the :doc:`search parameters <../user/search>`:

- Leave the keyword field empty
- Set a search parameter to ``Keep`` ``Linked by url`` ``Equal to``, and use the URL of the XML feed as the value
- Sort results by ``First crawled descending``
