Recursive crawling
==================

SOSSE can crawl recursively all pages it finds, or the recursion level can be limited when crawling large websites or public sites.

No limit recursion
-------------------

Recursing with no limit is achieved by using a policy with :ref:`Crawl condition <crawl_depth_params>` to ``Crawl all pages``.

For example, a full domain can extracted with 2 policies:

* A policy for the domain with a ``URL regex`` that matches the domain, and ``Condition`` set to ``Crawl all pages``

* A default policy (with the ``URL regex`` set to ``.*``) with a ``Condition`` set to ``Never crawl``

Limited recursion
-----------------

Crawling pages up to a certain level can be simply achieved by setting a :ref:`Crawl condition <crawl_depth_params>` to ``Depending on depth`` and setting the ``Crawl depth`` when :doc:`queueing the initial URL <add_to_queue>`.

Partial limited recursion
-------------------------

A mixed approach is also possible, by setting a :ref:`Crawl condition <crawl_depth_params>` to ``Depending on depth`` in one policy, and setting it to ``Crawl all pages`` in an other and a positive ``Crawl depth``.

For example, one could crawl all Wikipedia, and crawl external links up to 2 levels with the following policies:

* A policy for Wikipedia, with ``Crawl depth`` of 2:

* A default policy with a ``Depending on depth`` condition:
